decision tree stuff

*Find the most important question, and then split on it.
*Generate a list of all possible questions.
(each node is a question)
It's going to get very small because we're dividing by two, though.
Once you've created all the possible questions, apply the information gain functions to each one of the questions.
(Information gain function uses the entropy function)
Apply the same tree building on the children.
